            <description>I thought not. It&amp;rsquo;s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It&amp;rsquo;s a Sith legend.
Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.</description>
